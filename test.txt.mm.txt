		without interfere

		require high QoS
	2.1CR technique overview
		Define:
			Capability
				capture the variance
				without any interference
				defs   mmlinks = ../../Dropbox/mythinking.log
			Reconfigurability
				dynamically programmed
		KRKL (.... Language)
		Spectrum Holes[27], Fig3
		Architecture[34], Fig4
			RF-front end
				Filter
				LNA,AGC
				PLL,VCO
			#The RF end is the novel part
			ADC
				#require weak & wideband
				NYQ: notch filter, MIMO(spatial)
		Capability ->"Define"
			Fig5, cognitive cycle, like "state-machine"
			1.spectrum sensing
				physical level
			2.spectrum analysis
				link layer and upper
			3.spectrum decision
				link layer and upper, e.g. QoS
		Reconfigurability ->"Define"
			freq, modulation, power, interoperability
