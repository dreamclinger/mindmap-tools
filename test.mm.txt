	2.1CR technique overview
		Define: 
			Capability
				capture the variance
				without any interference
			def_CR  mmlinks=../../test.rtf
			Reconfigurability
				dynamically programmed
		KRKL (.... Language)
		Spectrum Holes[27], Fig3
		Architecture[34], Fig4
			RF-front end
				Filter
				LNA,AGC
				PLL,VCO
			#The RF end is the novel part
			ADC
				#require weak & wideband
				NYQ: notch filter, MIMO(spatial)
		Capability ->"Define"
			Fig5, cognitive cycle, like "state-machine"
			1.spectrum sensing
				physical level
			2.spectrum analysis
				link layer and upper
			3.spectrum decision
				link layer and upper, e.g. QoS
		Reconfigurability ->"Define"
			freq, modulation, power, interoperability
	4.Spectrum Sensing ->"2,determine"
		spectrum holes
			detect if PU receives data in SU's communicate range
			local observe by SU (second user, or xG user)
		transmitter/single detection
			#sense the signal from primary Transmitter
			matched filter
			energy detection
			cyclostationary
			other feature
			#but to sense signal from primary Receivers?
				maybe problem in Fig10
		cooperative detection
			#for 2 problems as follows in Fig10
			1. receiver uncertainty
				physically separated, range limit
			2. shadowing uncertainty
				hidden terminal problem
			centralized
				gathering
			decentralized
				exchange observation
			#overhead traffic
			#"1.receiver uncertainty" unsolved
		interference based -> "#"1.receiver uncertainty" unsolved
			#Example[63], the following is collected as model in Fig11:
			LO leakage power in RF front-end of the primary receiver
			in order to sense the LO power, low-cost sensors are nearby
				Q:too costy
				Q:low precision
			then sensors transfer the info to unlicensed users
			#the info is cumulative RF energy (of primary receivers)
			#and the max cap of tolerance is set
			#as long as unlicensed users don't exceed the cap, ...
				Q:what if many primary receivers
		challenges
			remained 'Q' -> 'interference based' 
			multiuser spectrum detection
				#interference based does not consider:
				more interference, more difficult to sense
				compete resources
				co-locate xG users
				#cooperative maybe suitable
			capability
				real-time sensing
					short time period
					e.g. energy based, OFDM.
					but when sensing system gets larger ...
					but when sensing tech gets more complex
	7.Spectrum sharing -> "2.coordinate (sharing)"
		#steps
		1.sensing
			spectrum holes availability
				i.e.->"4,Spectrum sensing"
		2.allocate
			based on availability and policy
		3.access
			avoid xG multiuser collision
		4.handshake
		5.mobility
			i.e.->"Spectrum mobility"
		#existing sharing techniques:
		1.dimensions, Fig12
			central/distribute
				where & who controls the access of xG multiusers
			cooperative/non-coop...
				whether to share the info of interference to other xG users (or not)
			overlay/underlay
				relations to licensed spectrum
					{dependent, noise-like}
		2.examples
			#Inter-network and intra-network spectrum sharing in xG networks,Fig13
			1.inter-network sharing
				#xG BS represents xG users demand to apply unlicensed band
				centralized[33],distribute[43]
					xG user demand selection, game thm
					utilization vs fairness vs throughput
					management via common spectrum coordinate channel (CSCC)
			2.intra-network sharing
				without interference to PU
					Q: still face the problem ->“2,remained ‘Q’, receiver uncertainty"
				1.grouping and sharing control channel(CC)[71]
				2.minimize spectrum allocation in group[50]
				3.when CC busy, use ad-hoc[40]
		challenges
			spectrum description may be not constant
				virtual cube model
					heterogeneous access types can be redefined
			CSCC
				the coordinate channel sometimes collide with PU
					receiver driven tech [72]
